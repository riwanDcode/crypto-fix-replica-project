# Security Considerations for Crypto Fix Platform

This document outlines important security considerations for the Crypto Fix Platform. Since the application deals with potentially sensitive wallet connection information, security is a critical aspect of the implementation.

## Information Handling

### Data Collection

The application collects the following information when users attempt to connect their wallets:

1. Wallet type (e.g., Metamask, Trust Wallet)
2. Access method (Phrase, Keystore JSON, or Private Key)
3. Selected service
4. Wallet credentials depending on the access method:
   - Seed phrase
   - Keystore JSON + password
   - Private key

### Data Transmission

- All form data is sent to the backend server via HTTPS (when deployed properly)
- The backend server sends the data via email to a predefined recipient
- **Important**: The application does not store any wallet credentials in a database

## Server-Side Security Measures

### Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse:

- 100 requests per 15-minute window per IP address
- This helps mitigate brute force attacks and potential DoS attempts

### CORS Protection

- In development: CORS is open to allow easy testing
- In production: CORS is restricted to specific allowed origins
- This prevents unauthorized domains from making requests to the API

### Environment Variables

Sensitive information is stored in environment variables:

- Email credentials
- Admin API keys
- Recipient email address

### Input Validation

The application performs input validation:

- On the frontend via form validation
- On the backend to ensure required fields are present

## Client-Side Security

- No storage of sensitive information in localStorage or sessionStorage
- Form inputs for passwords and private keys use password type inputs
- Clear form data after submission

## Monitoring and Administration

The application includes basic monitoring capabilities:

- Server resource usage tracking
- Request statistics
- Protected admin endpoints

## Security Recommendations for Deployment

1. **Use HTTPS** - Always deploy both frontend and backend with HTTPS
2. **Secure Email** - Use a dedicated email account with 2FA for receiving the wallet data
3. **Regular Updates** - Keep all dependencies updated to patch security vulnerabilities
4. **Logging** - Implement comprehensive logging but ensure no sensitive data is logged
5. **Authentication** - Add proper authentication for admin endpoints
6. **Environment Isolation** - Use separate environments for development and production

## Disclaimer

This project is for educational purposes. In a real-world scenario, handling wallet credentials would require additional security measures, and the approach of collecting seed phrases or private keys is generally not recommended in production applications.
